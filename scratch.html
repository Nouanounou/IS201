    <p>One of the earliest memories that I can recall where inspiration washed over me was when I was gathered to watch "Ratatouille" with my family for the first time. After hearing Gusteau's famous exclamation that "anyone can cook!", it became a powerful reminder in my life about what's possible and how intelligence transcends the bounds that mankind sets. I tend to get a laugh or two out of watching the scenes that proceed as Remy and Linguini develop a stronger relationship. However, I love this particular scene because it shows how determined Remy was to step up to the plate and remedy the disastrous situation. Sometimes I think that I get a bit carried away in this manner when I'm in the kitchen making a cherished meal. Feel free to click play and watch for yourself!

    <h2 id="Mission" class="underline"><b>My Mission Statement: A Life-Changing Experience</b></h2> <!--Can I use p-tags more strategically here?-->
    <p class="justify">I strive to live my life and patter my choices after the two year mission that I served for the Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter Day Saints. I had invaluable experiences from the coasts of the Jersey shore and the rich red landscapes of the Ivory Coast in West Africa. They stretched me and expanded my capacity to love. I also gained a passion for design and cooking which have remained as important aspects of my life today. I wouldn't trade the hardships I labored through or the miracles I witnessed for anything. Serving a full-time mission was a wonderful hallmark for my life and I look forward to helping others in the future. I wake up each day asking myself, who needs me today?

    <b>Primary Location: Regency, Virginia, 27531</b> 
    <p>Credited Colleagues: Chad Newman</p>
    <p>Chad Newman and I decided to conduct this research to graphically paint a picture about the modern Human Resource Workforce. The world and how companies conduct business is changing at an alarming place and there are areas in the world that are teaming with opportunties for ambitous professionals to position themselves in a sector that is critical for internal operations. I took a particular interest in visually "connecting the dots" to showcase specific factors that have contributed in the rise and necessity for strategists and analysts such as myself to brace for what its ahead related to the optimization of automation and human capital</p>
